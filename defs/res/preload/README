This directory and subdirectories contain information to preload resources within
a fresh system or incrementally. It also contains database dumps for later restore.

Preload Data:
-------------

The program performing the preload is the ion_loader process.
Note: the default mode of operation for preload is for going aginst GoogleDoc
spreadsheets on the Internet. File based preload is for testing and version control only.

Each subdirectory within this directory contains the files for a specific variant
of a loaded system.

The general directory structure for each variant is as follows (note: some variants are
historic and ):

./<variant>/              Contains all files for a preload variant

./<variant>/attachments   Contains attachment contents
./<variant>/ooi_assets    Contains OOI SAF export files and an override spreadsheet
./<variant>/ui_assets     Contains UI database export CSV files


Database Dumps:
---------------

A special directory is ./local/ which is not under configuration control. It is used to
dump and reload object contents from the database.

./local/<dump_timestamp>/                   Set of dumps at a given time

./local/<dump_timestamp>/<database name>    Dump for a specific database such as resources, events

The contents of the local subdirectory are not under version control and can be used
to dump data and to keep data for local testing.


The DatastoreLoader process is used to dump and restore.
